## Installation üõ†Ô∏è
No installation is required to run this program. Simply run the Python script, and you can start placing orders.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- No external libraries or dependencies required.

## How to Run the Program üñ•Ô∏è

1. Download the script (e.g., `ordering_system.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where the file is located.
3. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python ordering_system.py
   ```

4. The program will prompt you to input the number of orders, followed by user-specific details like name, quantity, product choice, and customizations.
5. After all orders are placed, the program will display the total cost and ask if you‚Äôd like to donate $1 to a good cause.
6. It will then display the final cost and a thank-you message.

## How It Works üìù

### Order Process
- **Step 1**: You can order a cake, ice cream, or ice cream cake by choosing the respective option.
- **Step 2**: For each item, you'll be asked to choose:
  - **Size**: Small (`s`), Medium (`m`), Large (`l`).
  - **Flavor**: Vanilla, Strawberry, or Chocolate.
  - **Topping**: Chocolate, Marshmallows, Sprinkles, or Candies.
- **Step 3**: After making your choices, the program calculates the price for your order.
- **Step 4**: You can choose to donate an extra $1 for charity.
- **Step 5**: The program will display the total cost for all orders.

### Sample Order Flow:
1. The user is prompted to select an item: `cake`, `icecream`, or `icecream cake`.
2. The user enters the quantity and customizes the order by selecting the size, flavor, and topping.
3. The program computes the cost of each order and adds it to the total.
4. After all orders, the program asks if the user would like to donate an additional $1 to their order.
5. The program displays the final total and prints a thank-you message.
